        <p>First, radically accept human nature.</p>
        <p>Then, learn to create value for society by combining foundational knowledge (learned through exposure to markets and physics) with specialised, cutting-edge knowledge.</p>
        <p>Apply this knowledge creatively to solve problems that nobody else in the world could've tackled.</p>
        <p>Use these unique solutions to help other people (and hence build a solid reputation).</p>
        <p>Respectfully question the constraints that most assume to be true. Then abstract out the durable compounding mechanisms at play, and plow as many resources as you can towards them.</p>
        <p>Don't be discouraged by people around you who get “lucky breaks”.</p>
        <p>Extend your time horizon as far as you can into the future.</p>
        <p>And if you do all this, you’ll never have to worry about being replaced (for as long as replacement is a worthwhile worry).</p>
        <p>There’s only one question left: <a href="./whats-next">what’s next?</a></p>
